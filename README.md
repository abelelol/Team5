Team 5's mobile app dev project "Dr. Sound"

Description: Imagine your a doctor in a third world country and
currently diagnosing a bunch of patients that have never been added
into a system. In third world countries most information is still
stored manually via papers which can further cause issues in keeping
track of patients. Luckily with this app a doctor will be able to
record a patients voice which will be assigned to a specific profile
with a patients information so that whenever a doctor uses our app
they'll just ask said patient to speak into the microphone which would
basically associate said profile to that sound. This will be done
using Microsoft's Speaker Recognition API.

Here is a brief flowchart showcasing how to navigate through this app.
